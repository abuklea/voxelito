# PRP Initial Report: Phase 1, Step 1 - Frontend Project Scaffolding

## 1. Objective
The primary objective of this task is to establish a clean, robust, and scalable foundation for the frontend application. This involves initializing a new web application project using the Vite build tool with the React and TypeScript template. The default boilerplate will be cleared, and a specific, feature-oriented directory structure will be created to ensure the project is well-organized from the outset.

## 2. Assignee
-   **Agent**: `frontend-architect`

## 3. Detailed Execution Plan

1.  **Clear Existing Files**: The current project root contains documentation and setup files. These will be backed up, and the root directory will be cleared to make way for the new project structure.
2.  **Initialize Vite Project**: A new Vite project will be scaffolded directly into the project root using the command `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`.
3.  **Install Dependencies**: After scaffolding, `npm install` will be run to install the base dependencies required by the Vite template.
4.  **Clean Boilerplate**: The default files and assets generated by the Vite `react-ts` template (e.g., `src/App.css`, `src/assets`, and the content of `src/App.tsx`) will be removed to create a minimal starting point.
5.  **Create Directory Structure**: The following directories will be created within the `src/` folder to establish the project's architecture:
    -   `src/features`: For feature-specific modules (e.g., chat, viewer).
    -   `src/components`: For shared, reusable UI components.
    -   `src/lib`: For library initializations and core helper functions.
    -   `src/store`: For Zustand state management stores.
    -   `src/types`: For global TypeScript type definitions.

## 4. Files to be Modified/Created
-   `package.json`: Will be created by Vite and define project scripts and base dependencies.
-   `vite.config.ts`: Will be created by Vite for build configuration.
-   `tsconfig.json`: Will be created by Vite for TypeScript configuration.
-   The entire `src/` directory will be restructured as per the plan.

## 5. Success Criteria
-   The project root contains a functional Vite + React + TypeScript application.
-   `npm install` completes without errors.
-   `npm run dev` successfully starts the Vite development server.
-   The `src/` directory contains the specified subdirectories (`features`, `components`, `lib`, `store`, `types`) and is clear of any default boilerplate content.
