# Voxel Diorama Generator - UI/UX Guide

This guide details the user interface and experience for each feature of the Voxel Diorama Generator, describing the various states and interactions.

## Main Application Interface

### Unified 3D and Chat Screen

#### Screen - Initial (Empty) State
-   **Description:** The user is greeted with a dark, immersive 3D environment (`Primary Dark` background) containing a simple ground plane or a subtle grid. A floating, semi-transparent chat panel with a glassmorphism effect (`Glassmorphism Panel`) is positioned on the right (desktop) or bottom (mobile).
-   **UI/UX Flow:**
    -   The chat panel is the focal point, with placeholder text in the input field: "Describe the scene you want to create..." in `Light Grey`.
    -   A subtle, pulsating `Accent Cyan` glow around the chat input invites the user to type.
    -   No 3D diorama is present, emphasizing the creative potential of the blank canvas.

#### Screen - Generating State
-   **Description:** This state is active after the user sends a prompt. The UI provides clear feedback that the AI is processing the request.
-   **UI/UX Flow:**
    -   The user's prompt appears in the chat history. Below it, a loading indicator appears, featuring a smoothly animating voxel shape glowing with the `Accent Magenta` color.
    -   The chat input is temporarily disabled to prevent multiple simultaneous requests.
    -   The 3D environment remains interactive, allowing the user to move the camera while waiting.
    -   The transition to this state is immediate, ensuring the user knows their request has been received.

#### Screen - Interactive State
-   **Description:** This is the default state once a diorama is generated. The user can freely interact with the 3D scene.
-   **UI/UX Flow:**
    -   The generated diorama is now the main focus in the 3D viewport. The model appears with a gentle fade-in or build-up animation.
    -   The chat panel displays the AI's confirmation message (e.g., "Here is the scene you described.") in `Pure White`. The chat input is re-enabled and ready for the next command.
    -   The user can use the mouse or touch gestures to orbit, pan, and zoom the camera. All camera movements are smooth and damped for a premium feel.
    -   An unobtrusive toolbar with icons for selection tools (single, box, brush) is visible at the edge of the screen, using `Light Grey` for inactive icons.

#### Screen - Voxel Selection State
-   **Description:** This state is triggered when the user interacts with the diorama to select voxels for targeted editing.
-   **UI/UX Flow:**
    -   As the user hovers over the diorama, the voxel under the cursor is subtly highlighted with an `Accent Cyan` outline.
    -   Clicking on a voxel selects it, changing its highlight to a more prominent, pulsating `Accent Magenta` glow.
    -   The selected icon in the toolbar changes to `Pure White` to indicate the active selection tool.
    -   The chat input's placeholder text might change to a contextual prompt, such as "Editing selected voxel(s)..." to guide the user.
    -   Holding 'Shift' while clicking allows the user to select multiple voxels. The selection highlight applies to all chosen voxels.
    -   Pressing 'Escape' or clicking on the background deselects all voxels, smoothly fading out the `Accent Magenta` highlight and returning to the Interactive State.

### Responsive Design: Mobile Adaptation
-   **Description:** The interface intelligently adapts to smaller screens to provide a seamless mobile experience.
-   **UI/UX Flow:**
    -   The chat panel moves from the right side to the bottom of the screen, taking up a smaller portion of the vertical space.
    -   When the user taps the chat input, the virtual keyboard appears, and the chat panel might expand slightly for better visibility.
    -   The selection toolbar is collapsed into a single icon that, when tapped, reveals the available tools in a small, elegant pop-up menu.
    -   Camera controls are optimized for touch: one-finger drag to orbit, two-finger pinch to zoom, and two-finger drag to pan.
